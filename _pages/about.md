I’m a first-year PhD student in [Quantitative Biomedical Sciences (QBS) at Dartmouth College](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/), mentored by [Dr. Nicholas Jacobson](https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/) in the [Artificial Intelligence and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology Guided Healthcare (AIM HIGH) Lab](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) at the [Center for Technology and Behavioral Health](https://www.c4tbh.org/).

My research focuses on leveraging `passive sensing`, `wearable devices`, `large language models (LLMs)`, and `just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)` to deliver scalable, personalized support for improving mental health. I’m particularly interested in integrating multimodal data with LLMs, optimizing the timing of interventions, and ensuring clinical safety in AI-driven systems. I’m also deeply interested in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for treating mental illness and in supporting sustainable well-being after treatment.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a master’s in clinical psychology from Columbia University and worked as a data scientist at the [Lab for Scalable Mental Health](https://www.schleiderlab.org/). My work focused on using digital, single-session interventions to expand access to care for marginalized populations, including LGBTQ+ and BIPOC individuals.
