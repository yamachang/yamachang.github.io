I am a first-year PhD student in [Quantitative Biomedical Sciences at Dartmouth College](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/), focusing on developing accessible and scalable interventions to improve mental health. I am currently rotating with [Dr. Nicholas Jacobson](https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/) at the [Artificial Intelligence and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology Guided Healthcare (AIM HIGH)](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) research lab within the [Center for Technology and Behavioral Health](https://www.c4tbh.org/).

I am passionate about data science and mental health research. My interdisciplinary research leverages computational techniques to analyze behavioral and language data from sources such as mobile sensors, intensive longitudinal studies, and social media platforms. Recently, I have developed a particular interest in the effects of psychedelics on mental illness. Ultimately, I wonder: can people suffering from mental illness fully recover with psychedelic-assisted therapy, and how can we support people in achieving a sustainably healthy life?

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received an MA in Clinical Psychology from Columbia University and worked as a Data Scientist at the [Lab for Scalable Mental Health](https://www.schleiderlab.org/). My work explored how digital, evidence-based interventions can enhance access to mental health care for marginalized populations, including LGBTQ+ and BIPOC individuals.
